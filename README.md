This is a lightweight package that provides efficient implementations of 1,2 and 3 dimensional Vectors and Tensors for continuum mechanics applications.
Lower dimensional elements (1D and 2D) keeps directional information: for example, a 2-dimensional vector in the x-y plane is different from a 2-dimensional vector in the x-z plane.
